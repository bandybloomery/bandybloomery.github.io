I was born and raised in Southwest Virginia and called Ferrum, Virginia home for 17 years before getting my B.S. in Biology from Radford University in 2013.\r\nI’ve dreamed of owning a farm for years and realized I didn’t need to move from our quaint little lot to have the romanticized “farm life” I frequently day dreamed about. I could do it right here, right now.\r\nIn March of 2021 I took a leap of faith and put my love of plants, ecology, learning, and being outdoors into action. I designed and built a small greenhouse around my late mother’s old steel frame that had been on my parents property from when she owned her own nursery in the 90’s. Before it was even fully constructed, I was already day dreaming of ripping out our front lawn to build more beds, and fill our tiny lot with beautiful flowers to share around the community.\r\nWithin a matter of weeks Bandy Bloomery had come full circle from a daydream to my day job! I feel very lucky to be able to fully dedicate myself to changing this semi-urban lot into a tiny flourishing flower farm. I work hard to bring beautiful, unique, and sustainably grown flowers straight from my house and farm to yours. I truly hope they bring you and your loved ones as much joy as they do for me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

      "contents": "\r\n\r\n\r\nWelcome to Bandy Bloomery! We are a micro-farm nestled in the Blue Ridge Mountains of the beautiful Roanoke Valley of Southwest Virginia.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe grow specialty-cut flowers using organic and regenerative agriculture techniques that keep our soil and plants as happy and healthy as possible. Sustainable floristry is the heart of our farm and we are dedicated to “no-spray” and “no-till”. This means we never use pesticides and take pride in building healthy living soil that grows stronger, more resilient and robust plants, without the use of conventional tilling.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tiny farm, which started as a simple idea to build a small greenhouse for personal use, quickly evolved into a fully-fledged business. Over the course of 2021, we broke ground and constructed an unheated greenhouse, added over 200 feet of gardens and perennial plant beds, and built-out a dedicated seed starting area. We are now in the process of expanding into nearly two dozen flower beds on our little (almost) half-acre plot. It seems every few weeks the lawn gets a little smaller and the garden gets a little bigger!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 2022 we plan to grow over 120 varieties of cut flowers throughout the season! Decorating and sharing seasonal flowers means you will never get bored of the ever changing shapes, colors, scents and textures of fresh flowers coming straight off the farm to your home.\r\nFollow along on social media and bring home a farm fresh bouquet today!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
