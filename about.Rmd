Hi, I'm Hillary! I was born and raised in Southwest Virginia and called Ferrum, Virginia home for 17 years before getting my B.S. in Biology from Radford University in 2013. 

Iâ€™ve dreamed of owning a farm for years and realized I didn't need to move from our quaint little lot to have the romanticized "farm life" I frequently day dreamed about. I could do it right here, right now.

In March of 2021 I took a leap of faith and put my love of plants, ecology, learning, and being outdoors into action. I designed and built a small greenhouse around my late mother's old steel frame that had been on my parents property from when she owned her own nursery in the 90's. Before it was even fully constructed, I was already day dreaming of ripping out our front lawn to build more beds, and fill our tiny lot with beautiful flowers to share around the community.

Within a matter of weeks Bandy Bloomery had come full circle from a daydream to my day job! I feel very lucky to be able to fully dedicate myself to changing this semi-urban lot into a tiny flourishing flower farm. I work hard to bring beautiful, unique, and sustainably grown flowers straight from my house and farm to yours. I truly hope they bring you and your loved ones as much joy as they do for me!
